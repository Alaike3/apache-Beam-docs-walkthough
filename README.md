# Easy Apache Beam - apache-Beam-docs-walkthough
## Purpose
Documentation is typically difficult to read and implement for various technologies. This is why various video tutorials exist to give people the start that they need to start building technologies.

The purpose of this repo is to help myself and others get started using Apache Beam by providing an accessible summary with code examples on how to create and deploy a pipeline. This is structured so that you encounter concepts in a JIT (just in time) manner - leveraging the knowledge at the point at which you need it.

However detailed - the best source is the official documentation which can be found here - https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#overview
